## travis-cov

A coverage reporter for [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/)/[Blanket](http://blanketjs.org/) that will fail a [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) build when the coverage threshold is too low.

Threshold is specified in the package.json file of the consuming project.

Add the key `"travis-cov" to the "config" key in your package.json file.  Under that key you can add any of the following properties:

`threshold: <number>,
global: <boolean>,
local: <boolean>`

See [Blanket.js's package.json](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/package.json#L42) as an example.

Alternatively, the desired threshold can be specified by setting its value in an environment variable named `TRAVIS_COV_THRESHOLD`. For example, to set the threshold to 75% from a UNIX-style shell:

```shell
TRAVIS_COV_THRESHOLD=75 mocha -R travis-cov
```

###usage
1. `npm install travis-cov`
2. Use a reporter argument, `mocha -R travis-cov`
3. Change scripts.test in your package.json file to use `mocha -R travis-cov`
4. Add `travis-cov` to the package.json file in the config section.  Add whichever keys you want (see above).
5. Set up your project with travis-ci
6. Commit, if your tests pass and the code coverage is above the threshold the build will pass, otherwise it will fail.
